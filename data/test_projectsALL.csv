The plan is to use a deep freeze freezer due to the insulation and ability to easily cool to a lower temperature when needed. It will be controlled by a Raspberry PI, Windows 10 and some temperature sensors, it will also include some weight sensors so I can determine the weight of the contents (kegs).
